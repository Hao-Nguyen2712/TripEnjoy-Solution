    signUpRequest.Password,
    signUpRequest.CompanyName,

5. Must verify email before login
6. Can book properties after verification
```

### **Partner Registration Flow (Enhanced)**
```
1. Partner visits /partner/auth/sign-up
2. Fills enhanced form (CompanyName, Email, ContactNumber, Address, Password)
3. Calls /api/v1/auth/register-partner
4. Account immediately activated (no email verification)
5. Redirects to sign-in with success message
6. Can immediately login and start document upload
7. Admin reviews documents for final approval
```
