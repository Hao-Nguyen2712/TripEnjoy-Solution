## Critical Implementation Gaps

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Blocking Revenue)

#### 1. Room Management System
**Impact**: Booking functionality completely blocked  
**Missing Entities**: RoomType, RoomTypeImage, RoomAvailability, RoomPromotion  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Why Critical**: Properties cannot define room inventory without this

#### 2. Enhanced Booking System
**Impact**: Cannot process multi-room bookings or payments  
**Missing Entities**: BookingDetail, BookingHistory, Payment, BookingVoucher  
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Why Critical**: Revenue generation and payment processing blocked

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Revenue Enhancement)

#### 3. Financial Transaction System
**Impact**: Manual partner payouts, no transaction history  
**Missing Entities**: Transaction, Settlement  
**Timeline**: 2 weeks  
**Why Important**: Automated payouts reduce operational overhead

#### 4. Review & Rating System
**Impact**: No trust signals for users  
**Missing Entities**: Review, ReviewImage, ReviewReply  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Why Important**: Reviews drive booking conversion rates

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Marketing Enhancement)

#### 5. Voucher System
**Impact**: No promotional capabilities  
**Missing Entities**: Voucher, VoucherTarget  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Why Lower Priority**: Can use RoomPromotion for basic discounts
