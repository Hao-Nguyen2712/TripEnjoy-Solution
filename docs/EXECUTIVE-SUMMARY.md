### Key Patterns Implemented

✅ **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- Aggregate roots with clear boundaries
- Strongly-typed value objects (PropertyId, AccountId, etc.)
- Rich domain models with encapsulated behavior
- Collection encapsulation with private backing fields

✅ **CQRS with MediatR**
- Commands for mutations (Create, Update, Delete)
- Queries for data retrieval (Get, List)
- Automatic validation via ValidationBehavior
- One handler per operation (Single Responsibility)

✅ **Result Pattern**
- No exceptions in domain layer
- Centralized error handling via DomainError
- Type-safe error propagation
- Consistent API responses

✅ **Repository + Unit of Work**
- Data access abstraction
- Transaction management
- Generic repository for common operations
- Specialized repositories for complex queries

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

### Two-Factor Authentication Flow

1. **Step 1**: User provides email/password → System sends OTP via email
2. **Step 2**: User provides OTP → System issues JWT tokens

### Security Features

✅ JWT tokens with short expiration (15 minutes)  
✅ Refresh token rotation (7-day expiration)  
✅ Token blacklisting on logout  
✅ OTP codes expire after 5 minutes  
✅ Rate limiting (5 requests/min for auth endpoints)  
✅ Role-based authorization (Admin, User, Partner)  
✅ Resource ownership verification  
✅ Cloudinary signed upload URLs  
✅ CSRF protection on all forms  
✅ Input validation (FluentValidation)  
✅ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
