  - `DELETE /api/v1/room-types/{id}` - Delete room type (Partner only)
  - `GET /api/v1/room-types/property/{propertyId}` - Get by property (Public)
  - `GET /api/v1/room-types/{id}` - Get room type details (Public)

- **Security**:
  - Partner role authorization on mutations
  - Ownership verification (partners can only modify their own room types)
  - Rate limiting enabled (default policy)
  - API versioning (v1.0)

#### **5. Blazor Frontend - Partner Portal**
- **Services**:
  - `IRoomTypeService` / `RoomTypeService` - API integration layer
  - Registered in DI container

- **Models**:
  - `RoomTypeDto`, `RoomTypeImageDto`
  - `CreateRoomTypeRequest`, `UpdateRoomTypeRequest`

- **Pages**:
  - `/partner/properties/{propertyId}/room-types` - Room Types List
  - `/partner/properties/{propertyId}/room-types/create` - Create Form
  - `/partner/properties/{propertyId}/room-types/edit/{id}` - Edit Form

- **UI Components**:
  - MudBlazor card-based layout for room type listing
  - Form validation with DataAnnotations
  - Delete confirmation dialog
  - Success/error notifications with Snackbar
  - Responsive design (xs, sm, md breakpoints)

- **Features**:
  - View all room types for a property
  - Create new room types with validation
  - Edit existing room types
  - Delete room types with confirmation
  - Display capacity, price, quantity as chips
  - Show cover images or placeholder

### **🧪 Testing Coverage**

#### **Unit Tests**
- **Domain Entity Tests**: 17 comprehensive tests (ALL PASSING ✅)
  - `RoomTypeTests.cs` - Create, Update, Image management, Status changes
  - Tests cover:
    - Valid and invalid room type creation
    - Business rule validation (capacity, price, quantity)
    - Image management (add, remove, set cover)
    - Status transitions (Active, Inactive, OutOfService)
    - Rating updates

- **Test Categories**:
  - Positive scenarios (happy path)
  - Negative scenarios (validation failures)
  - Edge cases (boundary values)

#### **Build Verification**
- Solution builds successfully with 0 errors
- Only warnings are pre-existing (nullable reference types)

### **🏗️ Architecture Highlights**

#### **Clean Architecture Compliance**
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic, no dependencies
- **Application Layer**: CQRS with MediatR, FluentValidation
- **Infrastructure Layer**: EF Core configurations, database access
- **API Layer**: Thin controllers, proper HTTP status codes
- **Client Layer**: Blazor WASM with service abstraction

#### **Design Patterns Used**
- **CQRS**: Clear separation of commands and queries
- **Result Pattern**: No exceptions, explicit error handling
- **Repository Pattern**: Generic repository with UnitOfWork
- **Value Objects**: Strongly-typed IDs (RoomTypeId, etc.)
- **Factory Pattern**: Static Create methods on domain entities
- **Service Layer**: API integration abstraction in Blazor

#### **Security Implementation**
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based (inherited from existing system)
- **Authorization**: Role-based (Partner role required for mutations)
- **Ownership Verification**: Partners can only manage their own properties
- **Input Validation**: Multi-layer (client, server, domain)
- **Rate Limiting**: Applied to all endpoints

### **✅ Acceptance Criteria Met**

- [x] Partner can create room types for their properties
- [x] Partner can view all room types for their properties  
- [x] Partner can edit room type details
- [x] Partner can delete room types
- [x] System validates: Capacity (1-20), BasePrice > 0, TotalQuantity (1-1000)
- [x] API returns 403 if partner tries to manage another partner's rooms
- [x] Blazor UI integrated with MudBlazor components
- [x] Form validation with DataAnnotations
- [x] Success/error notifications
- [x] All domain unit tests passing (17/17)

### **🔜 Future Enhancements (Not in Phase 1)**

#### **Immediate Extensions**
- [ ] RoomTypeImage upload functionality (separate image upload commands)
- [ ] RoomAvailability calendar management UI
- [ ] RoomPromotion management UI
- [ ] Application layer unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints

#### **Phase 2 Requirements**
- [ ] Booking system integration
- [ ] Payment processing
- [ ] Room availability checks during booking
- [ ] Decrement available quantity on booking confirmation

### **📝 Development Notes**

#### **Key Decisions**
1. **Generic Repository Used**: No custom RoomTypeRepository needed initially
2. **DTOs Separate from Domain**: Clean separation between API contracts and domain
3. **MudBlazor Components**: Consistent with existing UI framework
4. **Partner-Centric Routes**: Room types accessed through property context

#### **Known Limitations**
1. Image upload not yet implemented (requires separate image management commands)
2. Availability calendar UI pending (domain entities ready)
3. Promotions management UI pending (domain entities ready)
4. No integration tests yet (manual testing ready)

### **🎓 Lessons Learned**
1. **TDD Approach**: Writing tests first caught many edge cases early
2. **Value Objects**: Using `.Value` vs `.Id` required careful attention
3. **Blazor Type Parameters**: MudChip requires explicit `T="string"` parameter
4. **Authorization Pattern**: Consistent partner ownership verification across handlers

### **🚀 Business Impact**

This implementation unblocks the critical path to booking functionality:
- Partners can now define their room inventory
- Foundation laid for availability management
- Pricing structure established
- Ready for integration with booking system (Phase 2)

The platform has progressed from **45% complete to 59% complete** (17/29 domain entities implemented), marking significant progress toward the full marketplace vision.
